							<h4 className="article__heading">Early Life</h4>
							<p>
								I was born on the fifth of August 1998 in the city of Baden,
								Switzerland. I grew up in a small town called Wildegg with my
								norwegian father and swiss mother and my two little brothers. I
								spent a large part of my early childhood on my uncle's farm
								&#40;as my parents were both working&#41;, where I learned to
								appreciate the beauty of nature and the importance of hard work.
								During my kindergarden and primary school years you would find
								me with my friends and brothers in the neighborhood or the
								nearby forest.
								<br />
								<br />
							</p>
							<h4 className="article__heading">And then came the internet</h4>
							<p>
								Always having been a technically inclined boy, I was naturally
								fascinated when my father introduced me to the world of
								computers. It didnt take long until I got my hands on a computer
								of my own and started adventuring into the seemingly infinite
								depths of the internet. Whether it was playing games, reading
								about new concepts or just listening to music, computers became
								an influental part of my teenage years.

							<h4>Childhood pasttimes</h4>
							<p>
								In primary school I was a member of the local soccer team and
								played for a few years, after which I dipped my toes into
								table-tennis and kung-fu. I also took piano lessons for all my
								school years and participated in the annual theater play of the
								local church a few times &#40;I even got to play the lead role a
								few times&#41;.
								<br />
								<br />
							</p>
							<h4>How I spend my time now :)</h4>
							<p>
								While I still spend a lot of time online, I have a close group
								of friends and a good connection to my family, which keeps me
								socially active. With my friends I often play board-, card- and
								video-games, and like most I also watch movies and series and
								even read the occasional book when I'm alone. I genuinely love
								music and my Spotify is playing almost 24/7.{' '}
								<Link
									className="btn__inline"
									link="https://open.spotify.com/user/cyberniinja?si=7498d95d22e440e0"
									text="Check it out!"
								/>{' '}
								&#40;seriously, my Spotify statistics are a bit scary&#41;.{' '}
								<br />
								<br />
								In winter I spend at least one week on my snowboard in the alps
								and in summer I like to go hiking or camping. I also love
								travelling and would generally describe myself as an
								adventourous and explorative person.
